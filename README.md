# SpawnPointSave
SpawnPointSave is a robust Terraria server plugin built for the TShock API, designed to enhance player experience by automating spawn point management. Upon setting a spawn point, player coordinates are securely saved into a SQLite database. When a player logs in or respawns, the plugin retrieves these coordinates and seamlessly teleports the player to their personalized spawn location. Additionally, it intercepts standard Terraria recall items (Magic Mirror, Recall Potion, Ice Mirror, Cell Phone, and Shellphone), overriding their default teleportation behavior and redirecting players directly to their individually configured spawn points. The implementation uses asynchronous calls to maintain performance stability and minimize disruption to gameplay. The plugin includes command-driven spawn point setting (/setspawnpoint) with TShock permission integration (spawnpoint.set), ensuring controlled access and ease of administrative management.
